        <h2>About G</h2>
        <p>Geneti Phulst, universally recognized as the "Alternate Scientist," is renowned for his groundbreaking work in multidimensional exploration and genetic research. As the founder of the G Foundation, he has dedicated his life to traversing multiple worlds using his Multi-Universe Teleporter to collect samples, a pursuit that he considers his favorite hobby.</p>

        <p>Additionally, G possesses extraordinary abilities as a Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer, comparable to the legendary Gojo Satoru. His expertise lies primarily in genetic manipulation, evident in the creation of eight prototypes infused with genetic enhancements.</p>

        <p>Beyond his scientific accomplishments, G is a formidable entity. As an Alternate, he possesses the unique ability to morph into various forms or launch mental assaults on his targets, rendering him immune to physical and magical damage. Furthermore, he is a Stand User, commanding a powerful Stand with versatile abilities and formidable destructive power.</p>

        <p>G's unconventional approach to science is evident in his disdain for cultivation and immortal ascension, which he views as detrimental to scientific progress. His philosophy embraces the pursuit of knowledge through scientific exploration while rejecting mystical or esoteric methodologies.</p>
